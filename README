II) Choice of compiler:

  We have developed this program using the noncommercial version of
 the Intel Fortran compiler on the Linux operating system. Additionally,
 we have tested it using the gnu gfortran compiler. We expect it to work 
 with any Fortran 90 compiler. We are providing Makefiles both for Intel
 and gfortran compilers. We have not tested this program on the Windows
 operating system, but, we do not anticipate any problems.  
 

III) Libraries:

For the present program to work, it needs to link to LAPACK/BLAS libraries,
compiled with the same compiler which compiles this program. The location of
this library is specified by the variable LAPACK in the Makefile. For example,
with the Intel complier, we used the freely available ACML library of AMD,
Inc.  In case some other implementation 
of the library is used, the LAPACK variable in the Makefile should point to 
its location. Source files of LAPACK/BLAS library can be downloaded from
NETLIB (http://www.netlib.org), and then can be compiled using the 
compiler used for compiling our program. 

IV) Makefiles 

Makefile --- Makefile for PC based systems running linux and using
             Intel Fortran Compiler 
Makefile_gfort   -- Makefile for gfortran compiler 


V) Input preparation guide:

 Please read the file 'manual.pdf' (or 'manual.ps') 
 to understand how the input file is prepared for the program. 
 
 

VI) Input output files for example runs: 

The subdirectory 'Examples'  contains two subdirectories: (a) rhf and (b)
uhf. These sub-directories in turn contain example input and 
output files, corresponding to the restricted Hartree Fock and unrestricted 
Hartree Fock calculations discussed in the
paper. All the input files have extension .dat while the output ones have .out . 
Additionally some files with extension .xsf are there, which can be used to
visualize the system using the program XCrySDen. Moreover, there are  few more
files which are specialized outputs, described in the list below.


(A)rhf(subdirectory):

This subdirectory contains the following input files, and the corresponding
output files (with the extension .out). For example,

ppp8.dat   ---  Input file for total energy calculations of poly-para-phenylene with 
                eight repeat units.

ppp8.out   ---  Output file for total energy calculations of poly-para-phenylene with
                eight repeat units.
 
The convention we have adopted for naming the input files is system name, size of
the system, followed by the type of calculations. However, HF calculations and  
the standard parameters are taken as the genernal one and therefore, they are not 
specified in the filename, but in case of other type of calculations such as SCI 
or Hueckel model or calculations using screened (scr) parameters or something else, 
type of calculations is usually mentioned in the filename. 
    
For example, 
(i)   acene2_ciprep_orbden.dat => input file for oligoacene with two rings meant for
                                  performing just HF calculation, orbital density 
				  analysis, and generating output data for the subsequent 
				  correlated calculations.
		   
(ii)  tpa10_efield.dat => input file for a polyene with ten double bonds, HF
                          calculations were done in the presence of an external 
			  electric field.
			 
(iii) ppp8.dat => input file for HF calculations for oligo-PPP with eight repeat
                  units.
		   
(iv)  ppv8_scr.dat => input file for HF calculations using the screened
                      parameters for oligo-PPV with eight repeat units.

Installation Instructions:

  i) Untar and unzip the archive ppp.tar.gz.

  ii) Make sure that your default directory has a subdirectory bin. It should
      also be in your path.

  iii) Install some version of the LAPACK/BLAS libraries. Either obtain the
       noncommercial versions from AMD or INTEL, or download the source code
       from www.netlib.org, and compile and install those libraries using the
       compiler which you intend to use to compile ppp.x on your system. 

  iv) Modify the makefiles provided with this program so that it will compile
      with the LAPACK/BLAS libraries installed in step (iii).

   v) To compile the ppp.x program, enter subdirectory src and then

      a) type 'make' if you want to use the intel Fortran compiler
                  
                OR   

      b) type 'make -f Makefile_gfort' if you want to use the GNU gfortran
         compiler.

     If the compilation is successful, your bin directory will contain
     the program ppp.x.


  vi) To test the program go to a subdirectory (rhf or uhf) of the 
      directory Examples 
      

    In case you want to test the HF calculation for naphthalene using
    the RHF method, issue command

    ppp.x < ppv8.dat > x.out 

    Upon completion of the program, compare the contents of x.out to
    the file ppv8.out. They should be very similar to each other.
